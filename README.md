# Visconde, a literate toy/cob

Literate programming is great, right?

This is a toy program for playing with literate programming.

- `visconde.py` is a simple tangler (written in python 3)
- `visconde.lt` is the literate source for `visconde.py`

Run `python3 visconde.py your-source-file-here.lt` to compile `your-source-file.lt`

As it is, the tangler is language-agnostic. 

## Todo

- [ ] Warn if multiple root files are found (only proceed to
  generating these files if a flag is set)
- [ ] flag for dry-run (just warnigs, no output)
- [ ] flag to generate specific output files
- [ ] weave!

## Nice to have
